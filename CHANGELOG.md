## Transifex iOS SDK 2.0.1

*September 21, 2023*

- Addresses language tag discrepancy: The fallback mechanism for accessing the
bundled source locale translations, in case the target translations was not
found, was trying to access the file by using the format that Transifex uses
(e.g. `en_US`) instead of the one that iOS and Xcode use (e.g. `en-US`). The
logic now normalizes the locale name to match the format that iOS accepts.
